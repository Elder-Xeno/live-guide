## Description

Live Guide is a place for people who have a passion for live music. Whether you're an artist/band looking to promote an upcoming event, or you're an avid concert punter and are looking to share photos/videos of the gigs you've attended with other users. Users can upload images/videos of live music related content and then other users have a chance to check out your profile and see all your content, as well as any events you may have posted.
